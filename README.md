  ## Description
  This is a full stack blog application that allows users to create a profile, write blogs, view blogs of other users, and view and post comments on blogs. This application is currently not totally functional. Future work will be revising the code to allow for put and post requests so the user can submit a blog in their dashboard. The homepage is almost functional in that you can view all of the blogs and comments for those blogs. Additional work is needed to refine the login and logout process. CSS styling is also needed to make the application look more appealing.

  This application is deployed at: https://afternoon-earth-62646.herokuapp.com/
